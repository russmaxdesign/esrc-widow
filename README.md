1. The gap between the list and the content is too big on the essay page. Is there a variation you could do to the two-column layout to bring them closer together when there is only a list like this?

NARROWER CONTAINER
ADD AN IMAGE IN LEFT NAV LIKE LADY PAGES?

2. In previous exhibitions the captions have been italicized - could you please write that into the master css?

DONE

3. Could you think of an icon like we have for the others which looks good at small sizes? We could possibly do another W as in the Leadership Encyclopedia, in the green colour, but that might be a bit naff (W for Widows). But if we're looking to obviously link to the home page look and feel, would it be too awful to have a hat in a circle? Or would it be better to repeat the words of the main title, as done in the Canberra World War 1 exhibition. To see what I mean by icon, look at http://www.womenaustralia.info/exhibitions.html - maybe the text War Widows WW1.

DONE

4. I donâ€™t want to have a bulleted list in the second column. Is a way you can get the two titles to line up?
